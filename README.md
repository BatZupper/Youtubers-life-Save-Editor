## story of the project:
Youtubers Life always had a special place in my heart (I've like 91.2 hours on the game) and when a friend of mine told me that he had 100+ hours on it i decided to show him that I was the biggest YL1 fan so I started this project
at first i was very confused i spent hours looking at a save file on my trusty hex editor but i couldn't understand anything but i did notice something, every save file started with "H4sIA" wich was familiar too familiar. Looking a bit futher in the file it made it clear it was a GZIP file masked as a .yls save. So i tried to decrompress it and it worked! I had a fully understandable .tsv file that i could modify however i liked and manageg to do some little modifications
